# Foreq

My attempt in using 1-dimensional version of ResNet neural network architecture to predict distribution of ForEx prices conditional on historical price fluctuations.

The code that runs the training process is the commented portion in the end of loss.py file.

The experiment did not succeed to provide stable actionable trading strategy.
